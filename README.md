# Educational Game 1
In this project we aim to create an educational game that consists of **3 large parts**:
 
1. Pc game made with Pygame.
2. Board game version based on the PC game. [Download it here](https://github.com/vives-project-xp/EducationalGame1/tree/main/JOXE-game/JOXE-the-game)
3. Website to integrate and provide functionality to both versions.

On each of these platform we aim to inform our users and incorporate themes concerning **climate change** and the reality of its consequences depending on humanity's choices.

Our team consist of 4 students from Vives Brugge:
- Esteban (Scrummaster and Main Game Developer)
- Xander (Web Developer and all-rounder)
- Jasper (Sound Engineer and Asset Designer)
- Olivier (Board Game Developer and Administration)

- Project owner is Vives, guided by our teacher Ronny Mees.

All **resources** required to emulate this project are listed in this Repository either as direct data or viable links mentioned in designated markdown files, like this one.
To sum up in broad terms:
- Pygame is used to program the PC game and is based on the Python language.
- Vue.js and Node.js are used for the webpages.
- [] is used for creating sounds assets.
- Autodesk Fusion 360 is used for creating 3d-printable STL-files which may be used later in our project for creating tokens for the board game.
- Hobbymaterials like exacto knives, glue, acrylics and cardboard are used for the Board Game.

Much more **Documentation** can be found in the [Documentation-folder](./Documentation)
 like meeting notes, UML diagram for the PC game and our Work Breakdown Structure.

## PC-version:
Our goal is for a 2D, top down citybuilder similar to existing games like the _Cities-series_ as well as _Clash of Clans_. 
During the game the player will have to balance the size of their income, population and CO2 emmisions as well as create their own imaginary city on a gridlike structure by building and upgrading structures.
The game runs until the grid is fully occupied and upgraded or until the player's CO2 emmision score goes too low at which point they lose.
The Game Client will be able to be downloaded from the website and run on the player's device with some minimum requirements specified on the webpage.

More information about the PC-game can be found [here](./GameDocumentation/gameloop.md).

## Board Game version:
Our goal is for a grid-based puzzle game similar to existing games like _Cathedral_, _Patchwork_ and _My City_.
During the game the 2-4 players will be able to place tiles in various shapes and sizes on a grid in which they must balance the size of their population and Climate Impact.
The game runs until all tiles have filled up the board or until no tiles are left at which point a winner is calculated by the points they acrued during the game. 
For the educationaml part, aside from its themes, the box will be provided with a teacher pamphlet  that will provide guidance and a ready-to-go lesson plan. 
5 additional lesson plans will be made available on the website and will be themed around the same amount of missions.

## Webpage & link between both products:
The project will also contain a website to connect the PC-version and board game version with each other. There will also be added information about both products will also be displayed to present them in an interesting way to potential users.

Missions will be available via the webpage in which the players will get to play with an altered ruleset or start with a prewritten board state to overcome these challenges. These will be provided with lesson plans to provide content for teachers who want to use the board game to talk about climate change in a strucured and safe enviroment for teenagers.
