        "question": "How much degrees has the average surface temperature of the planet risen in the last 200 years?",
        "answers": ["2", "6", "8", "20"],
        "correct": "2",
        "solution": "The planet’s average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities. This is according to an investigation from NASA."

        "question": "Which of the following is a greenhouse gas (GHG)?",
        "answers": ["CO2", "CH4", "Water Vapor", "All of the above"],
        "correct": "All of the above",
        "solution": "Greenhouse gasses may be a result of natural occurrence or human activity. These gasses include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), water vapor, nitrous oxide (N2O) and ozone (O3)."

        "question": "What was agreed to in the “Paris Agreement” that came out of COP-21, held in Paris in 2015?",
        "answers": ["To protect biodiversity and end the deforestation of the world's rainforests", "To keep global temperature rise well below 2 degrees pre-industrial levels and to pursue a path to limit warming to 1.5 degrees", "To limit sea level rise to 3 feet above current levels", "To pursue a goal of 100% clean, renewable energy"],
        "correct": "To keep global temperature rise well below 2 degrees pre-industrial levels and to pursue a path to limit warming to 1.5 degrees",
        "solution": "The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change. It aims to keep the overall increase in global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius, with the hope of limiting it to 1.5 degrees Celsius."

        "question": "What is the Greenhouse effect?",
        "answers": ["The name of climate change legislation that was passed by Congress", "When you paint your house green to become an environmentalist", "When the gasses in our atmosphere trap heat and block it from escaping our planet", "When you build a greenhouse"],
        "correct": "When the gasses in our atmosphere trap heat and block it from escaping our planet",
        "solution": "The Earth receives solar radiation from the sun. Passing through the atmosphere, some radiation is absorbed by the Earth, while some is reflected back to space."

    {
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a consequence associated with climate change?",
        "answers": ["The ice sheets are declining, glaciers are in retreat globally, and our oceans are more acidic than ever", "Decrease in widespread migration of people across the globe.", "More extreme weather like droughts, heat waves, and hurricanes", "Global sea levels are rising at an alarmingly fast rate - 17 centimeters (6.7 inches) in the last century alone and going higher"],
        "correct": "Decrease in widespread migration of people across the globe.",
        "solution": "Climate change will impact the amount of mass migrations occurring for affected societies. As extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, continue to occur across the globe, more and more locations are becoming uninhabitable for people to sustain livelihoods there."

    {
        "question": "What can you do to help fight climate change?",
        "answers": ["Utilize public transit", "Consume less meat products", "Vote for political candidates who will advocate for climate-related legislation and policy improvements", "All of the above"],
        "correct": "All of the above",
        "solution": "All of these actions help minimize your own carbon footprint. By taking public transport, less cars will be on the road emitting GHG. Most of the world’s land is set aside for livestock, so by consuming less, less resources get used up in meat’s production. Along with these important steps, we also suggest adding your voice to the issues surrounding climate change, supporting clean energy and taking personal actions to reduce your impact on the planet."
