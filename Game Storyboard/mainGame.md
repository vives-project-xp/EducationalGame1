<h2>Game flow, target, end, ...</h2>
- What kind of game is this?
    This is in fact a citybuilder game, the player has to buy things in the shop with ingame coins. The more houses and places there are, the more people live in the city. Coins can be earned by having houses etc in the city. Sometimes, a main character gives the player trivia about the climate, depending on the decisions the player made.

- The game has a few elements that depend if the player is playing good or bad.
1)  The main element is a <b>CO2 score</b>, which can go lower or higher, depending on the deciscions the player makes.    For example, if there aren't much trees in the city, the score goes lower.
When this score is 0, the game is over. This is the only way the player can 'die' in the game. It is displayed on 
a progress bar in the right upper corner.

2)  In the game there are <b>coins</b> that can be earned. With this coins, assets can be bought in the shop. The coins can be earned by the assets that are already in theh city. They are auto-collected, so the player does not have to click on things to earn them.
