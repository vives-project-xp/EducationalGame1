    <h2>Mission 1 Waste Disposal:</h2>
    <p>In this mission there is a new mechanic that allows you to shift pollution tokens around.<br>
    <b>The Moral:</b> you may be able to shift trash around (like is done to many poorer south-east asian countries) and hope other people take care of things but this is not a solution to your problems.</p>

    <h3>Setup:</h3>
    <p>Normal Setup.</p>

    <h3>Rules Changes:</h3>
    <p>Whenever a player gets a Pollution Token, they may choose to pass it to the player on their left instead. 
    When they do so, they must give them one of their Population token as compensation.
    That player also gets to pass it along once more but at the cost of 2 Population tokens.
    This can continue until a player decides to keep the Pollution token.</p>

    <h3>End of game:</h3>
    <p>Winning and losing as normal.</p>

    <h2>Mission 2 Capitalism Rules:</h2>
    <p>In this mode the player with the highest amount om money tokens at the end of the game wins. Corruption runs rampant and nobody pays any mind to their Population or Pollution.<br>
    <b>Moral:</b> This is bad and will really end the game quickly with no winners and leave the world in ruin.</p>

    <h3>Setup:</h3>
    <p>Normal Setup.</p>

    <h3>Rules Changes:</h3>
    <p><b>New rule:</b><br>
    Add money tokens to the game.
    At the start of any player's turn they gain an amount of Money tokens equal to the amount of Populations tokens they currently have.
    Only the next building tile in front of the Auction Token is available for purchase. 
    If a player ends their turn without buying a Building or Land Expansion, that tile is put up for Auction.
    All players go clockwise and place bids on the tile, once a player passes they are out of the bidding race. 
    Keep going around the table, raising your bids until a winner emerges. 
    If nobody bids anything on the tile, it goes to the current player, who may still place it and immediatly end they turn thereafter.</p>

    <h3>End of game:</h3>
    <p>The player with the most money tokens wins the game but only (like usual) if the game ends before all pollution tokens are gone.
    All other rules still apply.</p>

    <h2>Mission 3 Cleanup Crew</h2>
    <p>In this mission players will build on polluted land, trying to restore it.<br>
    <b>Moral:</b> Picking up the pieces is difficult and makes us more aware of the mess we make. This will hopefully inspire us to think about the people that will live in the place after you're gone.</p>

    <h3>Setup:</h3>
    <p>Flip over all Commercial tiles and place 2 of these at random on the main board before starting.</p>

    <h3>Rules Changes:</h3>
    <p><b>New Action:</b><br>
    You may return a flipped tile back to their original state. This tile then becomes yours.
    Whenever a Land Expansion is added, the free tile you would normally get to choos is a flipped tile instead. Place it with al least 1 square on the Land Expansion tile.</p>

    <h3>End of game:</h3>
    <p>The player with most Commercial buildings wins the game.</p>

    <h2>Mission 4 Vive la Revolution:</h2>
    <p>In this mission, players fight for control of buildings in the middle of a bloody revolution.
    Moral: This mission is meant for competitive fun, with no real moral but to point out greed.</p>

    <h3>Setup:</h3>
    <p>Normal setup.</p>

    <h3>Rules Changes:</h3>
    <p><b>New Action "Conquer":</b><br>
    You may steal a building from another player 
    Whenever a Land Expansion is added, the free tile you would normally get to choos is a flipped tile instead. Place it with al least 1 square on the Land Expansion tile.</p>

    <h3>End of game:</h3>
    <p>Tally the amount of squares each player controls, the player with the most squares wins.
    Full board setup with buildings that can be conquered by spending population.</p>

    <h2>Mission 5 Shortages:</h2>
    <p>Players get less money and can buy or sell food tokens.</p>
