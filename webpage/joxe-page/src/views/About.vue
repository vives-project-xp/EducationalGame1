    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    This game was developed by Esteban Desmedt, Jasper Vantuyne, Olivier Westerman and Xander Vyvey in 2024 for VIVES.
    <br> <br>
    On each of these platforms (online and offline games) we aim to inform our users and incorporate themes concerning climate change and the reality of its consequences depending on humanity's choices.
    <br> <br>
    Our team consist of 4 students from Vives Brugge:
    <ul></ul>
    <li>Esteban (Scrummaster and Main Game Developer)</li>
    <br>
    <li>Xander (Web Developer and all-rounder)</li>
    <br>
    <li>Jasper (Sound Engineer and Asset Designer)</li>
    <br>
    <li>Olivier (Board Game Developer and Administration)</li>
    <br><br>
    <li>The project owner is Vives, guided by our teacher Ronny Mees.</li>
