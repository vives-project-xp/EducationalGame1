## Risks and Responses
List of assessed risks with rating 1-25 and reponses. rating is determined by multiplying Probability (High chance= 5 , Medium chance = 3, Low chance = 1) with Impact (High impact = 5, Medium impact = 3, Low impact = 1). Anything with a rating equal or higher than 9 needs a preplanned response.

Loss of Files/Code Prob 3 x Imp 5 = 15 Response: Proactive Backups every week kept by Admin
