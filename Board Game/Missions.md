# Missions
These missions will be listed on the webpage "Missions". 
Each one adds mechanics/tiles/tokens and/or cards to the base game.
Each mission is designed to be part of a lesson plan that any highschool teacher can use to fill at least one hour of class.

## Mission 1 Waste Disposal:
In this mission there is a new mechanic that allows you to shift pollution tokens around.\
The Moral: you may be able to shift trash around (like is done to many poorer south-east asian countries) and hope other people take care of things but this is not a solution to your problems.

### Setup:
Normal Setup.

### Rules Changes:
Whenever a player gains a pollution token they may pay the next player up to an equal amount in money tokens to make them take the pollution instead. 
That player then is allowed to pay twice the original sum to move this pollution to the next player. This continues until no one can pay this any longer.
Players get to discard one pollution token per nature tile they own at the end of their turn. Keep these pollution tokens seperate as they will count towards your end score.

### End of game:
The player who cleared the most pollution tokens during the game gains +10 Pops at the end of the game.
All other rules still apply. 


## Mission 2 Capitalism Rules:
In this mode the player with the highest amount om money tokens at the end of the game wins. Corruption runs rampant and nobody pays any mind to their Population or Pollution.\
Moral: This is bad and will really end the game quickly with no winners and leave the world in ruin.

### Setup:
Normal Setup.

### Rules Changes:
Only the next building tile in front of the Auction Token is available for purchase. 
If a player ends their turn without buying a Building or Land Expansion, that tile is put up for Auction.
All players go clockwise may place a bid on the tile, once a player passes they are out of the bidding race. 
Keep going around the table, raising your bids until a winner emerges. 
If nobody bids anything on the tile, it goes to the current player, who may still place it and immediatly end they turn thereafter.

### End of game:
The player with the most money tokens wins the game but only (like usual) if the game ends before all pollution tokens are gone.
All other rules still apply. 


## Mission 3 Cleanup Crew:
Full board but with extra blocker tiles that need to be removed by paying.

## Mission 4 Vive la Revolution:
Full board setup with buildings that can be conquered by spending population.

## Mission 5 Shortages:
Players get less money and can buy or sell food tokens.
