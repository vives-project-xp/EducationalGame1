# Missions
These missions will be listed on the webpage "Missions". 
Each one adds mechanics/tiles/tokens and/or cards to the base game.
Each mission is designed to be part of a lesson plan that any highschool teacher can use to fill at least one hour of class.

(## Mission 1 Nuclear Disaster:
Nuclear power plant is added to the game, any gains its benefits but can blow up horribly.
Setup: 
Start the game by placing two special Nuclear Tiles anywhere on the main board but not adjacent to each other.
After shuffling the Disaster Deck, place the 'Nuclear Disaster' card at the top of the Disaster Deck.)

Start the game as normal.

## Mission 2 Waste Disposal:
In this mission there is a new mechanic that allows you to dispose of pollution tokens.
The Moral: you may be able to shift trash around (like is done to many south-east asian countries) and hope other people take care of things but this is not a solution to your problems.

### Setup:
### Rules Changes:
Whenever a player gains a pollution token they may pay the next player up to an equal amount in money tokens to make them take the pollution instead. 
That player then is allowed to pay twice the money they gained from this to move this pollution to the next player. This continues until no one can pay this any longer.


## Mission 3 Capitalism Rules:
In this mode the player with the highest amount om money tokens at the end of the game wins.

## Mission 4 Cleanup Crew:
Full board but with extra blocker tiles that need to be removed by paying.

## Mission 5 Vive la Revolution:
Full board setup with buildings that can be conquered by spending population.

## Mission 6 Shortages:
Players get less money and can buy or sell food tokens.
