# Teacher Pamphlet

## Preface
This Board game is part of a university project of student from Vives (Brugge).\
Our purpose for this manual is to help you as a teacher prepare a lesson plan or even better, not have to worry about prep.\
This game can be played and is very enjoyable on its own but our mission is to educate as well as entertain.\
Of course, you are still free to alter and add/remove parts of these lesson plans, these are simply guidelines meant to help you and unburden you a little.\
The only preparation you will need is to read this manual and the Player Rules so you can explain it to your students, please make sure not to skip this step.

On its own, this game and this manual will provide a single lesson plan of 1hour with a few ideas on how to keep it running beyond that.\
We also recommend you take a look at our webpage () once you are finished with this booklet.\ 
There you will find 5 extra missions that each will have a lesson plan attached to it like this one.\
These are meant as follow-up material that builds on the main game, we recommend you have at least played the base game at least once before trying any of these special missions.

## Lesson Plan
### Overview
- **Grade Level:** Middle School (14+)
- **Subject:** Environmental Science
- **Duration:** 60 minutes

### Objectives
- Understand the concept of climate change and its impact on the environment.
- Recognize the factors contributing to climate change when building a city.
- Identify potential solutions and mitigation strategies for addressing climate change on an urban level.
- Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills through gameplay.
- Encourage social interaction between students in a safe environment, with supervision.

### Materials
- Climate Quest board game which includes:
    - Game pieces like tokens and tiles.
    - A main board with Land Expansion board tiles.
    - Game cards (Disaster cards)
    - Tracker board with Population and Crisis Score.  

### Procedure

#### Introduction (5 minutes)
1. Discuss the concept of climate change and how it shapes your city/town.
   - How much of it is tourism or industrial?
   - How much of it is residential?
   - How much nature is present in the city?
2. Engage students with questions about how a futuristic green city would look like.
   - Would you say our city is green/clean?
   - What's one thing you don't like about your city right now?
   - What's one reason why your city isn't that perfect green future version already?
4. Introduce the "Climate Quest" board game.

#### Game Setup (15 minutes)
1. Divide students into small groups of 2-4 players.
2. Provide each group with game materials.
3. Explain the objective and rules of the game.

#### Gameplay (30 minutes)
1. Allow the students to play the game on their own and answer any rules questions to the best of your ability.\
   Don't worry if you don't know a rule, feel free to make one up on the spot or let the students make a suggestion on how to use the rule,\
   simply try to keep the games running smoothly and make sure everyone is enjoying this little educational intermezzo.

2. Students will take turns in the game to place building tiles on the board and add Expansions to let the board grow.
3. The point of the game is to have the largest population but avoid high pollution.
4. Gameplay takes about 30min, if anyone is done early, ask them if they liked the game, who won and how?

#### Discussion (10 minutes)
1. Gather students for a debriefing discussion.
2. Reflect on experiences and challenges faced during the game.
3. Relate game scenarios to real-world environmental issues. **Morals**:
   - Puzzle game (Trying to build green cities is quite a puzzle)
   - Everyone shares the same Crisis tracker (= we all share the same planet)
   - Money is not what wins you the game (= people are more important than money)
   - The higher the crisis score, the higher the amount of disasters (= Climate change make natural disaster happen more often)
   - Everyone loses if the crisis tracker reaches its maximum (= There's no point in greedily building and making money if that means the end of the world)
   - Nature tiles help you protect against pollution (= We can integrate nature as a barrier to protect our cities from the worst climate disasters)
5. Brainstorm additional sustainability ideas. The Player Rules have a section with facts about climate change that can help you fill time if need be.

#### Conclusion (5 minutes)
1. Summarize key takeaways from the game and discussion. What did you learn?
2. Emphasize the importance of collective action and thinking together on how to solve issues. 
3. Encourage continued exploration of environmental topics.

### Assessment
- Informal assessment through observation and participation.
- Evaluate understanding based on discussion responses.
- Encourage written reflections or journal entries.
