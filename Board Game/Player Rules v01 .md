## Setup:
1. Place the main gameboard in the middle of the table and scatter the building pieces in a neat circle around the gameboard (Building Circle). 
2. Each player may pick a color and take all game pieces of that color and keep them in their player area, visible to all other players, there are no hidden items in this game.
3. Place one of the colored cube pieces from each player on the Pops tracker and the other on the Crisis tracker, both starting with a value of 0. 
4. Shuffle the Land tiles and then place them in the brown blind bag.
5. (Shuffle the Disaster cards, then place them face down within reach.)
6. Place the money tokens and polluction tokens in a handy spot and within reach of all players.
7. Every player starts with 5 money tokens.
8. Place the Auction token on the Building Circle in between two buildings in front of the player who wears the most green, they get to start the game.

## Winning/ Losing:
The player who at the end of the game has the highest Pop score wins the game.\
The player who at the end of the game has the highest amount of Pollution tokens loses the game (even if they had the highest Pop score) and gets to clean up the board or set it up for the next round.\
If two or more players have the same Pop score, count the amount of Nature tiles they control, the player who controls the most then wins.\
(Note: The player who controls the most adjacent Nature tiles at the end of the game may add 10 Pops.)

## Play the Game:
The players take turns in a clockwise rotation with the player that is currently wearing the most green in their outfit going first.


### Start your turn:
Collect an amount of Money tokens equal to your Population Score.\
Collect an amount of Pollution tokens equal to your Crisis score.

### Actions:
Only one action may be taken during your turn, unless otherwise specified in the action.
#### Get Corrupt:
You may increase your Crisis points by a maximum of 5 to immediately gain the same amount of Money from the bank. You may still Buy a Building or Buy a Land Expansion.
#### Buy a Building:
The Auction token determines which building tiles can be bought during your turn.\
Starting from the Auction token, the 3 pieces in front of the token (clockwise) are available for purchase. \
Each tile has a price printed on it which must be paid to the bank to obtain the Building.\
Move the Auction token to where the bought building was laying and place your new Building on the board.\
Make sure the Building Tile does not overlap with any Blockers. (Shaded red)
#### Buy a Land Expansion:
Pay 5 Money to the bank to draw and place an Land Expansion tile. \
Reach into the brown blind bag and pull out 1 tile. \
You must immediately place this tile with one edge (fully or partially) touching the gameboard or another Land Expansion tile.\
Note: You choose the orientation and which side of the tile is used.\
You may immediately place any (nature) tile from the Building Circle on the Land Expansion tile (fully or partially).

### End Your Turn:
When you can take no further actions, your turn ends.\
Move your colored cube on the Population and Crisis tracker to reflect the changes that occured by your actions.\
The amount of spaces for the Pops tracker is increased by the amount of (pop symbol) noted on your new building.\
The amount of spaces for the Crisis tracker is increased by the amount of (crisis symbol) noted on your new building.\
Note: this may leave you with a negative number in which case you do not lower your Crisis Score but instead get to discard Pollution tokens equal to the negative amount.\
The next clockwise player now starts their turn.

## Crisis Tracker:
The Crisis tracker only has one cube marking its progress and is shared by all players. Whenever a player buys or loses a building that has a (crisis symbol) score, increase (when bought) or decrease (when removed from the board) the overall Crisis score.\
Certain spaces on the Crisis Tracker are marked in red, these are what we call Thresholds.\ 
When a player moves the Crisis token on or past one of these Thresholds, that player draws a Disaster Card.

### Disaster Cards:
A player that forces the Crisis Score past or on a Treshold must draw a Disaster Card. 
This player then must perform the tasks on the card before the next player's turn can begin.

## When does the game end?
The game continues until:
- All tiles have been bought from the Building circle.
- If no room is available to place any building tiles and no Land Expansions can be bought.
- The crisis tracker has reached its maximum, the planet is now doomed and the player with the most nature tiles wins the game.
