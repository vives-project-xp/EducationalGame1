## Setup:
1. Place the main gameboard in the middle of the table and scatter the building pieces in a neat circle around the gameboard (Building Circle). 
2. Each player may pick a color and take all game pieces of that color and keep them in their player area, visible to all other players.
3. Shuffle the Land tiles and then place them in the brown blind bag.
4. Shuffle the Disaster cards, then place them face down within reach.
5. Place a random Disaster card at the bottom of each Pollution and Population container.
6. Fill the Pollution containers with their corresponding amount of pollution tokens then stack them on top of each other.
   Red is on the bottom and holds 5 tokens. Yellow sits on top of red and below green and holds 10 pollution tokens. Green sits on top of both and holds 15 tokens.
7. Fill the Population container with their corresponding amount of population tokens then stack them on top of each other.
   Red is on the bottom and holds 5 tokens. Yellow sits on top of red and below green and holds 10 pollution tokens. Green sits on top of both and holds 15 tokens.
8. Place the Auction token on the Building Circle in between two buildings in front of the player who wears the most green, they get to start the game.

## Winning/ Losing:
The player who at the end of the game has the highest Pop score wins the game.\
The player who at the end of the game has the highest amount of Pollution tokens loses the game (even if they had the highest Pop score) and gets to clean up the board or set it up for the next round.\
If two or more players have the same Pop score, count the amount of Nature tiles they control, the player who controls the most then wins.\
If all pollution tokens have been taken so that none remain, everyone loses the game.
(Note: The player who controls the most adjacent Nature tiles at the end of the game may add 10 Pops.)

## Play the Game:
The players take turns in a clockwise rotation with the player that is currently wearing the most green in their outfit going first.


### Start your turn/ Upkeep:


### Actions:
Only one action may be taken during your turn, unless otherwise specified in the action.
#### Buy a Building:
The Auction token determines which building tiles can be bought during your turn.\
Starting from the Auction token, the 3 pieces in front of the token (clockwise) are available for placement. \
Move the Auction token to where the bought building was laying and place your new Building on the board.\
Make sure the Building Tile does not overlap with any Blockers. (Shaded red)
#### Buy a Land Expansion:
Reach into the brown blind bag and pull out 1 tile. \
You must immediately place this tile with one edge (fully or partially) touching the gameboard or another Land Expansion tile.\
Note: You choose the orientation and which side of the tile is used.\
You may immediately place any (nature) tile from the Building Circle on the Land Expansion tile (fully or partially).

### End Your Turn:
When you can take no further actions, your turn ends.\
Take the amount of Population tokens and Pollution tokens from their containers marked on the building you just bought.
The next clockwise player now starts their turn.
#### Not enough tokens:
If not enough tokens are in a container, take the card from the bottom, read it and perform the action described on it. 
Then, place the empty container to the side together with the card so the next player can continue taking tokens from the one below.
#### Not enough containers:
Down to the last container? Emptying the last container either ends the game (see 'When does the game end') or has no special effect. 
These tokens are finite and shouldn't be refilled.

### Buildings:
Each Building Tile is provided with two numbers: Population and Pollution. These values determine how many of these tokens you get to collect or return at the end of your turn. 
Some building may have a colored edge which provides bonusses or penalties depending on what tile is touching that edge there.
On a green flank, the player that placed this building gets to either discard a pollution token or gain a population token. The next clockwise player that owns an adjacent building gets the result of the option that wasn't chosen. 
On a red flank, the player that placed this building chooses to either lose a population token or gain a pollution token. The next clockwise player that owns an adjacent building gets the result of the option that wasn't chosen. 
_Example: Xander places his building with a red and green edge on the board. The green edge touches two seperate tiles, one from Jasper and one from Esteban. The red edge touches a tile Olivier controls. For the green edge, Xander choses to take an extra Population and since Esteban is the next clockwise player that owns an adjacent tile, Estaban gets to discard a Pollution token. On the red edge, Xander chooses to gain a Pollution which means Olivier loses a Population._


### Population Containers:
The green, yellow and red containers hold different amounts of pollution tokens and can be stacked on top of each other.
Red is on the bottom with the yellow above that and the green one on top. 

### Pollution Containers:
The green, yellow and red containers hold different amounts of pollution tokens and can be stacked on top of each other.
Red is on the bottom with the yellow above that and the green one on top. 

### Disaster Cards:
A player that takes the last pollution token from the green, yellow or red container must draw a Disaster card.
This player then must perform the tasks on the card before the next player's turn can begin.

## When does the game end?
The game continues until:
- All tiles have been bought from the Building circle.
- If no room is available to place any building tiles and no Land Expansions can be bought.
- No pollution tokens remain, the planet is beyond saving and everyone loses.
When the game ends, check with the Winning/Losing chapter to determin a winner.
Note: the game doesn't end when all population tokens have been taken but does if all pollution 


Simplification:
No money, players just get to pick to go for land or building.
No Crisis, everything is handled through pollution tokens.
Pops remain and Pollution remain.
No trackers, instead use containers with set amount of tokens.

Complexities:
Add more of a puzzle element. Punish empty tiles
Maybe add time as an element?
Make 'disaster cards' related to Pop.
